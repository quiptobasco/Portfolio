# Week-2-Homework - Portfolio

## Description:

The purpose of the portfolio is to create an eye-catching website of projects I have created to submit to a prospective employer.  In its current state, this portfolio is more like a prototype which will be updated as the bootcamp progresses.  I will add more actual projects as they are finished, and make it look more professional as time goes on.
